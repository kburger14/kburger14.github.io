		<p>Well this is a good idea,<br>
		He wouldn&#39;t do it if it wasn&#39;t,<br>
		He wouldn&#39;t do it if it wasn&#39;t one.<br>
		Well my friend fancies you,<br>
		Oh what a way to begin it all,<br>
		You said, &quot;It&#39;s always exciting words to hear&quot;  </p>

		<p>And we woke up together not quite realising how,<br>
		Awkwardly stretching and yawning,<br>
		Its always hard in the morning,  </p>

		<p>And I suppose that&#39;s the price you pay,<br>
		Well oh it isn&#39;t what it was,<br>
		She&#39;s thinking he looks different today,<br>
		And now there&#39;s nothing left to guess now,  </p>

		<p>You left before the lights came on,<br>
		Because they didn&#39;t want to ruin,<br>
		What it was that was brewing,<br>
		Before they absolutely had to,<br>
		And how can you wake up,<br>
		With someone you don&#39;t love?<br>
		And not feel slightly fazed by it,<br>
		Oh, he had a struggle,  </p>

		<p>And they woke up together not quite realising how,<br>
		Awkwardly stretching and yawning,<br>
		It&#39;s always hard in the morning,  </p>

		<p>And I suppose that&#39;s the price you pay,<br>
		Well oh it isn&#39;t what it was,<br>
		She&#39;s thinking he looks different today,<br>
		And now there&#39;s nothing left to guess now,  </p>

		<p>Quick, let&#39;s leave, before the lights come on,<br>
		&#39;Cos then you don&#39;t have to see,<br>
		&#39;Cos then you don&#39;t have to see,<br>
		What you&#39;ve done... </p>

		<p>Quick, let&#39;s leave, before the lights come on,<br>
		&#39;Cos then you don&#39;t have to see,<br>
		&#39;Cos then you don&#39;t have to see,<br>
		What you&#39;ve done...  </p>

		<p>I&#39;ll walk you up, what time&#39;s the bus come?</p>
